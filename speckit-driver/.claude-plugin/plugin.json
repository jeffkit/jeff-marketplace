Enables Claude to intelligently drive the entire speckit workflow (constitution → specify → clarify → checklist → plan → tasks → analyze → implement) with minimal user intervention, using sub-agents for execution while the main agent acts as project manager. Enhanced with 3 quality gates and 4-layer task marking protection.",
